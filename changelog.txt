====================== WORK ========================================
Known Bugs:
- Sometimes plots empty if not viewed before csv export of another plot (only Mac ?)
- Sometimes restoring a data file created on another computer fails on Chromebook. 
  The same file might sometimes fail and sometimes work?
  This does not happen on Mac & Win with files created on Chromebook. 
  **These issues may be fixed in 0.8.55 but I still need to test this**

Front Burner Tasks:
- Clean up console.log
- Clean up comments & code

Back Burner Tasks:
- Revisit time shift
- Rationalize usage of calData vs plotData in plotting code
- display rezero icon on all zeroable plots when linked
- save/restore dataShift (?)
