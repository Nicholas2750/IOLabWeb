      <b>IOLabWeb is a browser based IOLab application whose main purpose is to allow students with Chromebooks and
        Linux machines (almost any plaform in fact) to perform experiments using IOLab without installing any software.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is still in its infancy so compared to the <a
        href="https://www.iolab.science/running-application.html" title="" target="_blank"> <b>Official IOLab
          Application</b></a> the capabilities of IOLabWeb are quite primitive. </p>
    <p>
      The code is currently under development and is not guaranteed to be stable or bug-free. In fact, if you find a bug
      or have an idea for improvement please email Mats Selen at <a href="mailto:mats@illinois.edu"
        title="IOLabWeb Bugs">mats@illinois.edu</a>.
      <i>Please do not contact IOLab Tech Support about IOLabWeb since they are not familiar with it.</i>

      <b>You need to use version 89 or higher of either the Chrome or Edge web browser.</b> Make sure cookies are
      enabled since these are used to store your options and calibration constants. The code is updated frequently so
      always do a "hard reload" to avoid problems due to browser caching of old code and images.

      Hovering over a control element will usually show its function. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p> I am creating the code as an open source project so if you are interested in collaborating please email me at <a
        href="mailto:mats@illinois.edu" title="IOLabWeb Collaboration">mats@illinois.edu</a> and I will be glad to point
      you to the GitHub repository.
    </p>
    <p>
    Help resources and tutorials will appear below as I have time - please be patient. </p>
